# EQ-Guide
This is a beginner's guide on how to create parametric and Wavelet EQ profiles for your IEMs

#### **Pre-requisites**
* **Android**  
  Wavelet  
* **Windows**  
  Equaliser APO with Peace GUI  
 
#### **Instructions**
* Head to your favourite IEM measurement database, my favourites are [squig.link](https://squig.link/ "Database of measurements from multiple reviewers") and [Crincacle's Measurement database](https://crinacle.com/graphs/iems/graphtool/ "Single largest measurement database").  
* Select your IEM from the list of IEMs mentioned  
* Select the IEM/Target you want to tune your IEM to be.  
* Make sure no other IEMs or targets are selected, it must only be your IEMs and the curve that you want to EQ to  
* Go to the Equaliser section  
* Select your IEMs from the dropdown menu under "Parametric Equaliser"  
* Set the AutoEQ range from 0 to 7000  
* Click on AutoEQ    
* Click on "Export" if it will be used with Equaliser APO on windows, or click on "Export Graphic EQ (For Wavelet)" to get the file needed for Wavelet on android  
* Name the file to your preference and import the file into wavelet or EQ APO  
* Congratulations you have equalised your IEMs successfully
